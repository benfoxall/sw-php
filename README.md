Talk: Service Workers for PHP developers


### Talk Plan

1. intro
2. what they let us do
3. why they're more for php developers
4. how to get started

---

* intro to js single-threaded sharing UI thread
* why workers were created, how they work
* how service workers compare to this

* can be spun up independantly, so allows network proxy & offline
* can intercept any request, allows reformatting potential
* doesn't rely on page being there, paves way for push notifications
* allows for background sync

* what's nice about this - it doesn't change FE code at all
* sits between a serve and the browser, an as much to do with php as fe
